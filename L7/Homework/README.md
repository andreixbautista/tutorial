# Homework #JSIV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Objects - can hold sets of linked information
	* Properties - are the data inside the Object
	* Methods - function inside Object.
	* for in loop - This will loop over each key in the object and finish when all of the keys have been iterated over. 
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation -
	With dot notation, we can just call the object name.
	Bracket notation is just like calling an item on an array, although with brackets we MUST use a string or number, or variable pointing to a string or number.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test L7/Homework/tests/JSIV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
