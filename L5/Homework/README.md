# Homework #JSII

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `for`
	use for looping system.
	* `&&`, `||`, `!`
	 "AND" operator. It is written with two ampersands (&&). This will evaluate both expressions and will return true if BOTH expressions are true. If one (or both) of them is false this operator will return false.
	 "OR" operator. It is written with two vertical bars (||). It will determine if one of the expressions is true. It will return true if one (or both) of the expressions is true. It will return false if BOTH expressions are false.
	"NOT" operator. It is written as a single exclamation mark (!). We saw this operator earlier when determining equality (!==). As before, the NOT operator will return the opposite boolean value of what is passed to it.

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test L5/Homework/tests/JSII.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
