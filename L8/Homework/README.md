# Homework #JSV

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* `prototype`--The prototype property allows you to add new properties and methods to object constructors.
	* Constructors -- like regular functions, but we use them with the 'new' keyword. 
	The purpose of a constructor is to create an object and set values if there are any object 
	properties present

2. From the top level of your `Precourse` folder, run `npm test L8/Homework/tests/JSV.test.js` to run the automated tests. You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
